TASK : Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
      "Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images".

Image Encryption Tool :

Overview :
This project is a simple image encryption tool developed using pixel manipulation techniques. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using operations such as swapping pixel values and applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel.

Features :

Encryption : Encrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques to obscure their contents.
Decryption : Decrypt previously encrypted images to restore their original form.
Operations : Implements basic operations like pixel value swapping and mathematical transformations to achieve encryption.

Usage:

1. Encryption:

*Load an image file (.png, .jpg, etc.).
*Apply encryption using chosen pixel manipulation technique.
*Save the encrypted image file.

2. Decryption:

*Load the encrypted image file.
*Apply decryption using the reverse of the chosen encryption technique.
*Save the decrypted image file.

Techniques Used :

*Pixel value swapping
*Mathematical transformations (e.g., addition, subtraction, bitwise operations)

Usage Example:

  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Install necessary dependencies (if any).
  3. Run the encryption tool with your chosen image file.
  4. Follow prompts to encrypt and save the image.
  5. Use the decryption tool to restore the original image from the encrypted file.
